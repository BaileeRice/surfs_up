-There is a marginal difference in temparture between Jun & Dec, roughly 4 degrees(mean)

-December tends to be less predictable temparture wise, this could be due to lower test frequency(count)

-Both months have more than adequate temps for a beach-front surfing shop, not too hot and rarely ever cold

SUMMARY:

Investors in this beachside venture don't have much to worry about in regards to weather, there are little to no outliers within the months of June, it stays around its mean of 74 degrees. December follows a similar trend, it just has a two outliers that are 10 degrees higher and lower than its avg of 71, this sporatic behavior can also be due to the overall less testing that was done during December. To be fool-proof, I'd recommend a even sample size of weather tests to really get an idea of what is to come.
